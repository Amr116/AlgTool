# AlgTool

This repository is a workplace for our project called "A Visualization Tool For
Learning Algorithms and Data Structures".

The main idea for this project is to create a visualization tool to help new
computer science students to understand basic algorithms and data structures.

We are 3 undergraduate students working on this project, and it is not allowed
to use or copy parts of this project without our permission.
